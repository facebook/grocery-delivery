# Contributing to Grocery Delivery
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process
All changes to Grocery Delivery are developed on this GitHub repo. Changes
committed are then rolled out internally before a formal release is done on 
RubyGems. Do not bump the Gem version in `grocery_delivery.gemspec`; maintainers 
will bump when the new release is ready.
